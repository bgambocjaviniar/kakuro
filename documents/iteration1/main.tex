\section{Introduction}


Kakuro or Kakkuro  is a kind of logic puzzle similar to a crossword but with numbers. It was developed and created by Canadian Jacob E.Funk,an employee of Dell Magazines in 1966. Like Sudoku, solving a Kakuro puzzle involves exploring different combinations and permutations.\\

The objective of the puzzle is to insert a digit from 1 to 9 inclusive into each white cell such that the sum of the numbers in each entry matches the clue associated with it and that no digit is duplicated in any entry. \\

The purpose of this document  is to depict how to use it, its operation, maintenance, or design of software of the kakuro puzzle. It will also describe its functions, graphical user interfaces, requirements and constraints of the game. The details on how to play will be detailed in the use case, diagram and more details will be available in the upcoming design phase.\\


\subsection{Purpose}

This Software Requirements Document (SRD) describes the specification of the Kakuro puzzle game, which is in partial fulfillment of the requirements of COMP 354- Introduction to Software Engineering. It will define the requirements of the user interfaces, user stories, the rules and how this software works.The analysis model will include use UML, case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams and state transition diagrams. Furthermore, a detailed
project plan will be provided, including the schedule of the upcoming phases. This document is intended primarily for the members of  Team PK-A and the project co-ordinator, Dr. Gregory Butler, as it will serve as a basis for the upcoming phases of the project.
 

\subsection{Scope}

Screen shots of the user interfaces will give the player an idea on how the game will look once it is completed. The user case will be based on every scenarios possible when the game is being played. The user description will include the target audience and working environment of the game. Specifications for the game will be outlined in the specific requirements section and the analysis model will contain UML diagrams. The use case diagrams will give an overview of the functions of Kakuro and how the users will interact with the game. The class diagrams will show the interrelationships between the different objects in the game and the sequence diagrams will model the flow of logic within the game.



\subsection{Context}

The software we are building is a puzzle game called Kakuro, which we are solely building it as a desktop application. We will be building other features in conjunction with the game mechanics of Kakuro as part of the experience that differs from the usual gameplay. The users are players of the game, who are able to interact with the application by playing as a known or as an anonymous user. The desktop application will utilize a database to store information, such as scores, users, difficulties, and other important information. 


\subsection{Business Goals}

The objective of this project is to design and implement a single-player desktop application of the game Kukuro. The application will enforce the rules of a classical Kukuro game. It will allow a single player to play a random 10x10 Kakuro, and it will also keep track of the best play record of each registered user.

\section{Actors}
Anonymous user \\\\
Anonymous users are players who are not registered but want to play the game without having added value to their gameplay. They have the same functionality as a normal user, but they have limited usage with the software application. If the anonymous user wants to ever save their score into our system, they will need to create an account. (no timer / not able to pause  if we allow timer / not able to view highscores of others /  other things?) \\

Registered user\\\\
Registered users are users who created an account and are able to fully use all the features in the desktop application. As a registered user, they can view the overall scores of all users, as well as their personal scores.\\

\subsection{Overview}

\section{Non-Functional Constraints}

In Kakuro, each puzzle consists of a blank grid with sum-clues in diverse location. The objective is to fill all empty squares using numbers from 1 to 9 so as the sum of each horizontal block equals the clue on its left, and the sum of each vertical block equals the clue on its top. Furthermore, no number may be used more than once in the same block.

One way to solve a Kakuro puzzle is incremental that is by using the current information on the board where you can find with certitude the value of a specific cell which can take only one possible value.

\section{User Interface}

In Kakuro, the User Interface should be concise and easy to navigate users to register,login,start and finish the game. It is the bridge connecting the users and our Kakuro game, a convenient and friendly user interface can guide the users through the whole game play in order to improve the users' overall experience. The user interface should help users to familiarize the game and guide them to complete the game successfully.
